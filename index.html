        <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p><b>1. </b>My full name is Tran Minh Nhat but you can call me by my RMIT name Nhat Tran. My student number at RMIT is s3926629. I am a member of Ice Tea. I was born on June 3rd, 2003. I am a Kinh Vietnamese born in Ho Chi Minh City and my Hometown is in Cu Chi. I was a student of Chi Lang Primary School, Go Vap, HCMC, Nguyen Du Secondary School, Go Vap, HCMC, and Student of Nguyen Cong Tru High School, Go Vap, HCMC.- I speak  Vietnamese, English, and French. Fun facts: I currently own not ONE but TWO different pets in my house, a dog and a cat, respectively. Both of them were my best friends, although the latter is a bit naughty. I have a deep knowledge of Chemistry, and also a very good memory of Politics and Governments – a highly sensitive topic: For the former, I can correctly write many different types of chemical equations, from Easy to Hard, in a matter of seconds. I can also research and understand many different chemical processes that are off-topic to High School books. For the latter, I can memorize the name of various heads of state and government, past and present, as well as monarchs and members of multiple royal families, from Vietnam and nearly 30 countries and organizations (By the time of this part, I am still trying to remember the names of more than 200 current and former world leaders who attended the Memorial Service of former South African president Nelson Mandela [note] in 2013.) In my free time, I usually play some games on my phone (Knowledge-based games in fact), as well as watch TV and read the news (whenever I watch TV, I will usually turn in for the news program.) Originally, IT (Information Technology) was not my first choice when I was young. At that time, my knowledge about this was completely limited, and I did not know anything about IT and was aiming to become an English teacher instead. But it all changes in Grade 11 (2020)… Following the end of the Computer Science Vocational Test in July 2020, I checked the result of my class. I was one of the highest! And that thing marks a complete change in my journey. I immediately scrapped the English-teaching way and went directly for only one route: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. I have many different ways at this point. Originally, I aim for a spot at the University of Information Technology, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (UIT-VNUHCM). But then, after consultations with my parents, along with some critical thinking, I decided to choose my true destination: RMIT University. I was originally aiming for a state-owned University. But, following a trip to the RMIT Saigon South campus, along with my participation at many different conferences here, I decided to settle here. The reason is: I was completely fascinated by them. Its buildings, its infrastructure, its ways of learning, its teachers and lecturers,… And after hearing that this place was the Top-ranked University on Information Technology, along with the information that RMIT’s certificates will be accepted across the world, I have no choice but to go for this university. To reach this point, it has taken me a very long journey, to improve both my knowledge and my way of living. Now, as an IT student, I will try to further my knowledge of, not only in IT but also in other aspects, including Maths, English, and Electronics. I will also learn many different skills and strategies, such as Teamwork, Imagination, and Creativity. This will ensure I have enough energy, to prepare myself for future work and life. IT was not my original choice. But however, I discovered a thing that not even my friends and family know. I have an intense passion for Computer Systems and Digital Appliances! I am also really fond of exploring and researching things such as Social Media, AI (Artificial Intelligence), and 3D technology. And recently, when the government’s COVID-19 app got multiple errors which leads to its bad rating on App Store and Google Play, I know that “the time has come”. I immediately draw my plan to create “the best apps in the world”, and to show the whole planet that: “Vietnam will, sooner or later, become the “new Silicon Valley of South East Asia”.” (Daniel Maxwell, 2012) [1]. And my IT journey truly begins… </p>

        <p><b>2. </b>My name is Vo Nguyen Nhat Kha. My student number is s3924422. My email address is s3924422@rmit.edu.vn. I was born in Da Nang on July 3rd, 2003. I am a Vietnamese University student. I am a member of Ice Tea. I speak Vietnamese and English. My hobbies are listening to music, watching educational and entertainment videos, watching fan arts, manga, manhwa, and manhua, playing video games, experiencing different cultures. I am an eccentric person who enjoys creative content on the Internet. I value originality and creativity. My ambition is to invent Quality of Life products for creating new content. I am interested in the application of new ideas and inventions. I believe that human activities are limited by the current technological level, especially in information. My interest started when I was in high school in 2018. My IT teacher showed me the potential of IT. I was taught JavaScript and Panel, HTML, and Arduino. I saw that RMIT has a course about Artificial Intelligence, which is a technology that can be used to improve our lives. RMIT also has great educational methods and facilities. I have a plan to study abroad in Australia if possible. I expect to learn new knowledge and skills about various IT-related topics. My ability to do teamwork activities is also something that can be improved in my time studying here. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p><b>3. </b>My name is Mai Gia Phu. My student number is s3927049 My email is s3927049@rmit.edu.vn. I am from Vietnam. I am a member of Ice Tea. I am an 8.9 GPA, IELTS 7.0, 12 years excellent student. I speak Vietnamese and English. I play Basketball, Football. I can do some magic to impress you when we meet at the campus! My hobbies are playing games and working out. “Life keeps changing, so people must be flexible” is my motto. Information Technology is developing so fast in modern society, so my goal is to learn artificial intelligence to modernize our country. At a young age, my father bought a personal computer and we usually played games on it; during his working hours, I started to explore what that computer can do. There were a lot of questions inside my head at that time. I have had a connection with my computer since I was only 5 years old and I have always been blown away by the infinite possibilities of what a computer can do. After that, my curiosity is uncontrollable when seeing some cool new technologies. During my spare time, I learned about coding on the internet but that is not enough for me. I want to truly understand the power of technology so I chose RMIT as my next stop. At RMIT, I can participate in the overseas education system while still staying in Vietnam. Another reason is I want to focus on my IT career so RMIT is a perfect choice because I don’t have to study compulsory side subjects. I expected to learn in RMIT both in a fun and practical way. I’ll learn about the basics of IT in this course and hope that I can make my dream project come true by the end. I’ll also do some self-study with the help of RMIT mail to access Linkedin learning.

<br><br>
<p><b>4. </b>My name is Nguyen Duong Truong Thinh. My student number is S3914412. My email address is s3914412@rmit.edu.vn. I am a member of Ice Tea. I was born in Ho Chi Minh city which is located in Vietnam but my family moved to Long An province for better living quality. Now I am living with my grandparents because my parents have to work far from home. I learned English when I was a child at 6 years old and I can communicate well in English at the present. To talk about my dream, I wanna become a staff working as an IT technician in any kind of company and field. From my personal perspective, I really like to work with computers because it is quite common in the age of technology. I am a person who loves to learn about computers despite knowing their complexity. Moreover, I will sharpen my creativity and I can learn to get the job I dream of. My hobby is playing games like board games with friends. Then I can create my own strategy to advance my skills which are likely the same as IT. I found my interest in IT when I was still a student in high school and I watched a short video about working in an IT environment by using computers competently. “ Wow, it is amazing. Watch that modern equipment! I want to be one of the technical members “ - my mind at that time. After 3 years in high school, I graduated high school and started to find my own major but no one told me IT is really complicated and harsh until I saw people give up their careers. I ask myself whether to continue or conclude here but I wanna challenge myself once in my life and of course, I pursue this main system program. As a leader of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh once said "study, study more, study forever" and I found the idea that studying is never enough. The short clip below here is one of those which bring me to IT:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA">youtube.com/watch?v=AkFi90lZmXA</a> The reason I chose RMIT as a place for studying and increasing my knowledge is that this is 100% in English. I can feel I am studying abroad with high facilities and academic support but still in my lovely country. Furthermore, I can even learn how to solve problems in a professional way. I would like to achieve experience from successful pioneers in order to come up with a strategy of mine.  </p>

<h3>GROUP PROCESS</h3>
<p>We helped each other write the report and role assignment and task completion went smoothly. When we gain a better understanding of GitHub then we can start collaborating there not just Phu doing most of the work. There can be a lot of improvement on the communication part, most of us did our job alone and have very few talks, we just have a meeting when we have an important event that need to be discussed. However, everyone is very responsible in this assignment, jobs have been done on time. If we working again in the future, surely, we will have better communication because we have known each other fairly well.</p>

      <h2 id="Project Description">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3><br>
<p>Currently, people frequently apply AI techniques to their lives in the new society. Self-driving cars, virtual assistants, facial recognition are widely popular around the globe which are the hottest topic using AI. However, there is another product called RoDog that is really different from them. This project is about an AI Robotic Dog, it can cure humans’ loneliness and have enjoyable as well as convenient functions.
In a huge picture, people can make friends with a RoDog and communicate with it, or if they want they can transform into a normal dog. Furthermore, RoDog will help people to do anything which a normal dog cannot. If people have to compare a robot dog and a regular dog, perhaps the robot will meet more needs. Additionally, it will solve problems that humans cannot participate in. This sounds great for human life in 2022 so the project for an AI RoDog is born.
<br><br><b> Motivation: </b>This sounds a little bit weird but a robot dog will help people more even though it's not real. A lot of people have to spend a huge amount of money to take care of their pets and they always have to clean up the waste and fur from them. Therefore, a robot dog will be the right choice for those who agree with the above opinion or those who do not have time or have allergies. In addition to saving money to take care of them, people will limit cleaning day by day. If there are some people who start with bringing home a RoDog, it will surely create a global trend in the future. People won't be able to resist the cuteness and the flexible ability to do many things of a robot dog.
<br><br>In most markets around the world, there are several products competing with our RoDog project. Among them are devices that use AI to automate control, such as automatic dishwashers or service staff robots. All competitors will probably have a hard time with RoDog but we believe there will be people who would love to have a dog made from automatic machines. RoDog has a lot of features to be part of the family, the voice recorder allows it to recognize voices and follow any human action. But people must remember that only actions within the scope of RoDog. Comparing a RoDog with a service robot, there may still be many shortcomings, but RoDog will gradually improve and bring benefits to us humans.

       </p>
       <br><br>

  <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
  <br><h3>Aims</h3>
      <p>  <br><br>To talk about general in my group work, everyone has contributed a lot of work in this project. The project is going to be done in a few days before the deadline. I will divide the progress of RoDog into 3 parts: the way RoDog is proposed to turn into a dog that can both work and help people, RoDog's perfection from materials to products to meet most user needs, advancement of science computers to help create a mechanical product called RoDog.
<br><br>
•	This is the idea of Phu Mai - the founder of RoDog, this robotic dog is turned into another version of Sony's Aibo cyberdog. In the beginning, our team discussed with each other to create RoDog just to satisfy the petting criteria of customers who like novelty/kinds of new. But then we thought that machines could be automated and bear the weight of their operations. From here, a RoDog like mini robot is created that has 2 goals to achieve the group's progress. The first is that it will act as a domestic dog that you usually keep and it only needs to be charged instead of fed. Second, when your family needs a tool that can help with housework, carry things, it can also serve as a robot.
<br><br>
•	Finding materials to help RoDog withstand impacts in all environments is also difficult when using high-value materials. The exterior of RoDog is designed with stainless steel to ensure the durability of the machine along with light weight to help RoDog move more agile. The color of RoDog can be changed depending on the owner's preference. Overall, RoDog has met most of the needs to satisfy consumers but they need to spend a large amount of money to bring back this product because it will practically resemble a real dog.
<br><br>
•	Computer science is at a cutting edge these days, and the inventors have brought AI to make our products automated. It can be said that AI will help RoDog operate independently, not based on the control of the remote control device. RoDog will use human voice recognition like Siri on iPhone and also a private secretary to take notes or make appointments. In 2022, many items need technology to work effectively, so the birth of RoDog will be easier to reach customers than before.
<br>
“The merit of all things lies in their difficulty.” (Alexander Dumas, the Three Musketeers)

<h3>PLAN AND PROGRESS</h3>
<p>“I was dreaming of having a dog since my childhood, in fact, most of us like dogs, but not all dreams come true. My parents did not allow me to own one so the dream was buried down the sand. At the age 18, after studying intro to computer system course at RMIT University, I found out that I can still make my dream and all other kids come true, that is why I invented Rodog.” – Phu – Founder of Rodog.
<br><br>
At first, we had an idea to make a robotic dog but that will contain nothing special about the project and also, that is not comparable to a real dog. So, we decided to upgrade it using AI. With built-in AI, Rodog team believe that it can replace the real dog experience to users as well as cure your loneliness. We saw a huge potential on the project and its market, people needs and curiosity, also a huge step in the AI industry that create a mass adoption, Rodog definitely a trend-maker for big companies to produce their AI pets in the future, but Rodog will always be the OG of this trend and become trend leader. There are so much potential that we can explore in this project, our vision is to make Rodog a must-have device in middle class users or above. That is why our mission is to bring this dream come true and also improve it. Rodog will be the future!
<br><br>
To talk about general in my group work, everyone has contributed a lot of work in this project. The project is going to be done in a few days before the deadline. I will divide the progress of RoDog into 3 parts: the way RoDog is proposed to turn into a dog that can both work and help people, RoDog's perfection from materials to products to meet most user needs, advancement of science computers to help create a mechanical product called RoDog.
<br><br>
•	This is the idea of Phu Mai - the founder of RoDog, this robotic dog is turned into another version of Sony's Aibo cyberdog. In the beginning, our team discussed with each other to create RoDog just to satisfy the petting criteria of customers who like novelty/kinds of new. But then we thought that machines could be automated and bear the weight of their operations. From here, a RoDog like mini robot is created that has 2 goals to achieve the group's progress. The first is that it will act as a domestic dog that you usually keep and it only needs to be charged instead of fed. Second, when your family needs a tool that can help with housework, carry things, it can also serve as a robot.
<br><br>

•	Finding materials to help RoDog withstand impacts in all environments is also difficult when using high-value materials. The exterior of RoDog is designed with stainless steel to ensure the durability of the machine along with light weight to help RoDog move more agile. The color of RoDog can be changed depending on the owner's preference. Overall, RoDog has met most of the needs to satisfy consumers but they need to spend a large amount of money to bring back this product because it will practically resemble a real dog.
<br><br>
•	Computer science is at a cutting edge these days, and the inventors have brought AI to make our products automated. It can be said that AI will help RoDog operate independently, not based on the control of the remote-control device. RoDog will use human voice recognition like Siri on iPhone and also a private secretary to take notes or make appointments. In 2022, many items need technology to work effectively, so the birth of RoDog will be easier to reach customers than before.

</p>
  <br><br><h3>Roles</h3>
        <p>
        <br><br> Vo Nguyen Nhat Kha: Idea generator. Kha is the one who thinks of features for the RoDog and the plan to build and market it. He will brainstorming a whole lot of ideas which will then be analyzed and approved by the whole group. This is essential because there are other dog robot products in the market and we need something creative and unique to be able to surpass them.
        <br><br>
        Mai Gia Phu: Designer. Phu will design the structure of the robot and the mechanical gears required to build it. He is responsible for the product RoDog and it is good to have a design that is the most efficient and economical on top of that. It is vital for the development of connection between the dogs and electronic devices such as smart home.
        <br><br>
        Nguyen Duong Truong Thinh: Assembler. Think will be the one to build the RoDog. Putting things together to create a final model is no easy task, that’s why someone like Thinh is important for initial manufacturing process.
        <br><br>
        Tran Minh Nhat: Tools and materials provider. Nhat will provide the tools and materials necessary to complete the project. Nothing can be done without resource. From a small chip to an AI, all parts of a RoDog is limited by what they are made of. Important financial decisions will also affect the progress of this project, so Nhat can help the group with his wisdom.

         </p>
<br><br>
<h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
      <p>
      <br><br>We will only create a prototype with simple functions. For now, there are only two cameras and three sensors, not six cameras and ten sensors for reaction. A fully charged RoDog will only run for 8 hours instead of 14 hours. It will only remember 200 different faces, not 1000. Connections to smart home devices and control using voice command prompt will be basic. It learning capabilities will be also not completed. This means that the RoDog cannot be taught new unique behaviors and functions just yet. It can only carry up to 5kg. The estimated lifespan is 5 years. Only white color models will be built without any pattern. Controller and app will be the ones available for most users and the two other control options will be for a limited edition. As we do not have enough manufacturing capability, for now, only 5 products will be made in the provided timeframe. All of this occur because we did not have enough money to build the perfect Rodog, later on, after this prototype success and have user as well as the media heart, we will surely overcome those obstacles.
       </p>
       <br><br>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
  <p>
    Regarding of tools and software needed, the first thing we need is the MicrosoftTM Azure AI platform. This is the base for the entire product, as it offers all kind of capabilities (personality, vision ability and speech recognition). About this, some of us have already learn about the Python platform, and thus are capable to do the programming (albeit not enough). The 2nd thing is the Google Cloud database to store all the information that he has learn.
    <br><br>
    As for the design, the product will be made using Aluminum, which is strong and light. Also needed are some cameras and microphones, as well as some appliances from smart home companies, in order to connect RoDog to the devices.
    <br><br>
    Some iOS and Android app development is also a must for this project, in order for the users to control the dog more easily. Dynamic balancing will also be enacted in order to keep it from falling…

  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Testing</h3>
  <p>
  At this point, I will put the RoDog to treat the members of our group, and then some of our friends, with things and challenges from our thoughts. The participants for the preliminary tests (called “Dog Testers” or DTs) will include some of us inside the group, our friends from outside, and even the teachers/lecturers** and/or staff. All of them are required to have experience of having a pet, and 5-10 people will participate. The DTs will order the RoDog robot to do something for them, and then they will check to see if they got the thing that they requested or not. For example:
<br><br>
- smiling at them
<br><br>
- directing them to get food
<br><br>
- asking the dog to do something for them
<br><br>
- … (anything that a regular pet can do)
<br><br>
If at least 80% of the orders are completed with satisfaction from the beta-testers, the RoDog preliminary test will be considered “successful” and it will be ready for other larger tests. Otherwise, it will then be returned back to the creators for some modifications, before retaking the tests.
<br><br>
Getting this in reality is a very hard challenge, as we do not have enough time for this, and also the DTs are quite busy with their works, thus not having sufficient amount of time to participate in the test. But this will eventually be taken soon, and it will serve as a base for future renovations to this wonderful product.
<br><br>
(**: Will likely include one from inside the class and one from outside the class. The testing plan must be sent to the main Project Manager and received a pass from all members of the group. The final announcement relating to this will be made in a group meeting later)
<br><br>
</p>
<h3>Time Frame</h3>
<img src="images/timeframe.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>
Mentioning about this RoDog is the challenge that all of us have to face. As stated earlier, the project will be made using the Azure AI program. Some of us, even myself, does not even know that this thing existed (we have nothing in our mind about this), and the platform is quite hard to programming (despite we have said that we have learn some Python). Another issue is that the Google Cloud database may not be big enough for the RoDog to hold a large number of data, and thus not being able to use for large gatherings (like parties).
<br><br>
Other issues including:
<br><br>
- The limited supply and price of Aluminum products.
<br><br>
- Specialized cameras and microphones may not be available.
<br><br>
- Not enough time for development.
<br><br>
-...
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
<p>When we first started on the first assignment, in our heads, we thought it would be difficult to get to know each other and not understand each other, so we would have many difficulties while working. Depending on each person's own point of view, the working frequency of each individual can be determined, but in general, each person needs to listen to opinions more and identify right or wrong/positive or negative. From there listening to understand, the group will have a common voice and make the joint project more convenient. Besides that, the cooperation of each person also requires responsibility which is an essential aspect to create an effective team.
  <br><br>
  Group 27 we all plan each assignment and set up a meeting every Tuesday and Wednesday night via Messenger and Discord. These are 2 apps that we use a lot to text and call each other. Fortunately, all 4 people actively gave their personal views to communicate on the project, so the work progress was quite smooth. The work was divided equally at first in the first 2 assignments, but in this last assignment, the quality of the work was heavier. Therefore, it requires more investment of time and research by all 4 people. All 4 members are in the same tutorial class, so the frequency of meeting once a week is enough because the online meeting time is also a lot. For assignment 3, we have to schedule more to divide jobs evenly and learn more things from this course.

<p>
As we earlier mentioned, the RoDog project needs some very experienced people who have already sometimes working for other similar products, as well as people who cared about animals and pet (due to the nature of this project). In actuality, RoDog development members need some of the following skills:
<br><br>
1.	Have good technical expertise: the RoDog use various programs to operate, among them the Microsoft Azure AI, as well as some Python. We need some types of individuals who can worked easily on the AI environment, as well as some gifted programmers.
<br><br>
2.	Pet-loving people: we are doing a robotic dog, isn’t it? Thus, we need people who not only loving pets in general, but also having special care for animals, as without them, the RoDog cannot goes toward the journey.
<br><br>
3.	Teamwork: the most important of al
<br><br>
“Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress and working together is success.” (Henry Ford)
<br>We need some nerds who have experience working as a team before. He/she must be active during all parts (attending most, if not all, meetings; finishing everything before the deadline, and so on), as well as having knowledge about the pet-caring and robots in general (in order to made RoDog a good product for all consumers)
<br><br>
4.	Others: he/she must be able to manage and control the flow of the RoDog program. They also need to accept comments (and complains) from users so that they could try to improve the product. And the last thing is Innovation, which required everyone to be creative and continuously think of new things for this project.

Finally, it comes to the end of the journey of Ice Tea Group and Intro to IT course. I’ve learnt a lot in the pass time. Many things happened and I appreciate all of that. At first, I let Mr. Long randomize my group because I did not know anyone then, so I met Nhat, Kha and Thinh. It was very hard to communicate with my teammates at the beginning but soon I get used to it and it improved a lot by time. In this last assignment, I think our group have done a great job and work very well together, maybe because we have worked together since assignment 2. Work flow was great, everyone has their own job, we frequently have a meeting to check on anybody else. If there is one thing that could be improved is my teammate creativity, they have done their work on time and fine but that just stop at “fine”, no one really have an idea about how to be more creative on the work and really put their heart into it. One thing that made me surprised is our group start to become closer and help each other not only on this course but other courses as well so that make me very happy. In general, I enjoyed being in Ice Tea group and hope we can still help each other like this after the course end!
</p><br><br>
<h3>Nguyen Duong Truong Thinh</h3><br>
<p>
So, the end is coming and the end of this IT course and I myself have learned more things from everyone. Becoming a better version of myself and I am quite satisfied with the first course of this semester. At first, I thought it would be difficult to contact everyone because everyone seemed cold and introverted. But everything seems to be going quite smoothly to create my IceTea team including Phu, Nhat and Kha. From my personal perspective, a thing that surprises me is the division of work and people's understanding of IT. I feel happy now that the team is done working just waiting for the results. If there is a chance, let's meet everyone in the following courses and we will meet again and advance together. The last thing I want to say to everyone is thank you for always helping and I learned a lot from you guys!
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Tran Minh Nhat</h3><br>
<p>
  So far so good, we eventually reached this final point at last. As the clock ticking nearer and nearer to the end of this semester, it is the time to rethink all of our journey. For the past 6 weeks (or more), all of us have worked together very vigorously for both this Assignment and the previous one. All of our works (including deadlines for each individual, as well as weekly meetings on Discord) were all smooth and it contributes to the success of our product(s). Group work, in overall, is very efficient and all 4 of us have not only act as teammates, but also friends as well (last Friday we have some “collaborative” discussions for the Intro to Computer Systems exercise…). With all of our care, our product eventually reached out to the community (probably with flying colours).
  Reaching this point is a very big honor for me. But like other members, we were surprised that sometimes we went behind other groups, despite the fact that we have tried to start the groupwork as soon as the team was created. Also, we have some problems with aesthetics (all of us have different writing styles).
  In summary, I am extremely proud to become a member of the IceTea group and with that I have learned more about becoming a responsible member of the IT community. I have done (albeit not truly excellent) my part of this group and I am looking forward to see the final result of all our efforts.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Vo Nguyen Nhat Kha</h3><br>

<p>
As a group of 4, we have worked together very well in the third assignment. Writing the report for the project “RoDog” was a mind-opening experience. We assigned tasks for each person and gave deadlines for information submission which were all in time throughout the assignment. Online meetings were held every Wednesday for discussion and important decision-making. We provided care and attention to create a product that stands out among its contemporaries. Group work is efficient and without conflicts. One thing that can be improved is aesthetics. Since we each have our own style of writing, we did have trouble organizing information with a unified format. Our font sizes were all over the place making the report not good-looking enough. I was surprised that the progress for the project was slow when compared to other groups though because we did have an earlier headstart than the previous assignment. Being a member of IceTea, I have learned more about the intricate details of an IT plan such as a timeframe table. We could not collaborate on GitHub as our experience on the site was still too limited to risk the assignment. I have done my part in the group and I am looking forward to the fruit of our effort.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3>IceTea</h3><br>
<p>
Generally, everyone in the team at the time of the sprint to the end of the project contributed a lot to build a fairly well-rounded product. All members have improved what is lacking in the process of working together as a team. All 4 people know how to use some basic new applications in IT such as GitHub, GitBash and Python code. Perhaps because the working time is not much, there are few surprises that happen during the working process, but the most prominent is a story about the old project we just planned to submit for the last assignment. When the idea of making an application InterMind - the founder is Kha, was chosen and considered as a success by the team, the lecturer said that the project must be done as something specific and close to life, then everything completely fell apart. We had to get together with the team and come up with a new plan to replace the old one to suit the requirements of this assignment. And so RoDog - an AI-powered smart dog became our team's project.
<br><br>
The whole team for many weeks continuously working together also knows briefly how each person's working attitude is. Nhat and Kha are two members who always have seriousness during the process of working and contributing ideas to the project. Phu is given the role of leader of the team and he always brings motivation to the team, refreshing the tasks so that everyone can maximize the project-building mindset. Thinh with the state of always putting responsibility on top, he often checks messages and always supports people to solve situations while working.Through assignment 3 on this group project, 4 people showed their progress and overcome their shortcomings:
<br><br>
•	About Nhat, this guy always looks to the positive in every assigned task, he learns to organize his time and plan his work more clearly.
<br>
•	Kha, who was the quietest member of the group since the beginning, now contributes ideas with everyone to build lessons. He became more active which was a bit of a surprise to us, but it shows that the team is growing well.
<br>
•	Thinh is a person whose skills in using software are not as good as the rest, but lately he has been trying to learn how to use them more and get used to them to contribute to the project.
<br>
•	Phu has learned the role of a team leader to accelerate the progress of a project and he knows how important the responsibility of a team leader is in a small team. Gradually Phu is getting used to this and is braver than before
